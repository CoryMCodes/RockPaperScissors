# RockPaperScissors
Classic way to break a tie, or decide who gets first dibs. 

This project was build as part of The Odin Project's fundamentals course.
The original objective was a simple game of rock paper scissors to a score of five using buttons against a computer opponent. 

In order to challenge myself and make something unique I added mulitplayer functionality and timed selection via keypress.

Instructions:
1. Click Start to start a round
2. You have 5 seconds (indicated by countdown bar) to select an option using the assigned keys.
3. Repeat until one player reaches a score of 5.  

Note: Changing from single to multiplayer during a game, resets the score counter.
